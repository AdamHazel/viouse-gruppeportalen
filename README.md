# About VIOUSE Gruppeportalen
VIOUSE is a concept project that was created by a group of students for their exam in Internet Services, taken in their third semester of the Software Engineering program offered by UiA Grimstad, Norway.
The goal was to create a project using .NET. This project could be seen as a first attempt at a bachelor project, thus a complete report was also written. A key requirement of this project was to use the Scrum methodology.

## Reflections
Having learned the basics of .NET and the MVC architecture, it was exciting to develop user stories, use Figma to create visual suggestions to solutions, and use Jira to manage Scrum sprints and our backlog. Scope creep an ever-present challenge to be dealt with as it was the first time producing a "larger" project. For a full discussion regarding the project, see the report ("Report.pdf").
